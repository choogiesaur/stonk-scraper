# Stonk Scraper

About

This is a NLP web application that predicts whether a stock price will go up or down based on the sentiment of a tweet about a company. Although it is currently set to only scrape tweets from Elon Musk's timeline, the goal is to eventually parameterize it to take custom UI inputs and scrape from any Twitter feed.
